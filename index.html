    <h1>My Cats</h1>
    <p>We took Leo and Nala on the airplane on our way back home, it was fun flying with kittens. Leo and Nala are threee years old now. Toby and Zazu are six months old now.</p>
    <p>I have four cats, two sets of siblings. There are three boys and one girl. My family and I got Nala and Leo in Florida. We got Toby and Zazu from my friends neighbor in the beginning of quarantine.</p>
  </body>They are all short haired cats. Leo has all black fur with light green eyes. Nala has brownish orangeish eyes and calico fur, with a half black half speckled face. Toby has four white paws and a white chest. He is grey with patterns and we can't see his eye colors because he is partly blind. Zazu has brown fur with patterns and brown eyes.
